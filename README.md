So, how did the Sentinels win this tournament? While VALORANT is a complex game, statistics of players are one thing, but strats and the synergy of a team is another as well. We won't be able to take a look at the latter, only the former, with this dataset. Let's take a look at the data to see if there are any anomalies looking at the stats of each players, while also data cleaning and using visualizations to see.
